        <h3>My Development Journey</h3>
        <p>
          Currently mastering modern web technologies including React, Node.js, and cloud platforms. 
          My mission is to bridge the gap between creative design and robust functionality, 
          creating digital experiences that are both beautiful and powerful. Every project is an 
          opportunity to learn, grow, and push the boundaries of what's possible.
